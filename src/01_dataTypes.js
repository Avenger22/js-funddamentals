 * @description This is a test to see how well you understand data types in javascript.
 * Write your solutions right below the comments. Use any tools you need to check the answers
 *
 * Don't remove the comments, Ed needs to know what's going on.
 *
 * As tempting as it may be, don't look in the previous exercises for answers. I don't care if you can open them.
 * I care if you can do these yourself 😊
 *
 * If you get stuck on a task - that's good. It means that we're not wasting time here.
 * Note it and skip it. We will later cover it in a 1x1 session and make sure you udnerstand it :P

// 1. create a constant called 'pi' and assign it the value of 3.14
const pi = 3.14



// 2 create a variable called 'radius' and assign it the value of 10
let radius = 10

// 2.1 now, change its value to 20
radius = 20



// 3. create a variable called 'area' and calculate the area using your variables
//   The formula is: area = pi x radius-squared
let area = pi * Math.pow(radius, 2)



// 4. Create an array called 'garage' with these cars inside:
//   - volvo
//   - audi
//   - mercedes
//   - bmw
let garage = ["volvo", "audi", "mercedes", "bmw"]

// Now, without manually typing the array:
// 4.1 add 'ferrari' to the garage
garage.push("ferrari")

// 4.2 remove Mercedes from the array
let filteredGarage = []
let garageCopy = [...garage]
filteredGarage = garageCopy.filter(car => car !== "mercedes")

// 4.3 replace the 2nd car in the array with 'lada'
garage[1] = "lada"

// 4.4 create an array with all of the cars in the garage capitalized

// 4.5 find the volvo. pretend you don't know what the array looks like.
const matchString = garage.find(car => car === "volvo")
const matchIndexOfString = garage.findIndex(car => car === "volvo")
console.log(matchString)
console.log(matchIndexOfString)


// 5 Create an object called 'myself' with these properties and assign them your values.
// Use appropriate datatypes for the values:
//   - name
//   - age
//   - isHungry
//   - favouriteAnimal
let myself = {
    name: "Jurgen",
    age: 35,
    isHungry: true,
    favouriteAnimal: "lion"
}

// 5.1 Replace the favouriteAnimal with 'turtle'
myself.favouriteAnimal = "turtle"

// 5.2 add an address property, which tracks your city, country and street name
myself.address = "tirana/xhomlliku"

// 5.3 add a list of favouriteFoods to the object. Add your favourite foods to the list (duhhh!)
myself.favorouriteFoods = ["meat", "pasta", "all other lol"]

// 5.3 remove the age property
delete myself.age

// 5.4 Have a snack. Set isHungry to false (even if you're not really hungry).
myself.isHungry = false

// 5.5 Add a function to the object called 'eat'. It should take a food as an argument and return "Name ate food!"
// That's a mouthful, so here's an example:
// e.g. calling the eat function with a banana argument, in an object where the name is 'Nico' should return "Nico ate banana!"
// e.g. calling the eat function with an apple argument, in an object where the name is 'Ilir' should return "Ilir ate apple!"
myself.eat = (food) => `${myself.name} ate ${food}`

console.log(myself)
console.log(myself.eat("grosha"))
